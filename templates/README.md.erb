[YOU SHOULD FILL ME IN: What does this app do?]

## Quick links

* **Staging:** [FILL ME IN]
* **Production:** [FILL ME IN]
* **Trello:** [FILL ME IN]
* **GitHub:** [FILL ME IN]
* ...

## Architecture

* **Backend:** Ruby on Rails 4, PostgreSQL, Redis (for background jobs)
* **Frontend:** ES2015 (transpiled using [Babel] to ES5)

[Babel]: http://babeljs.io

## Getting started

After you've cloned this repo, run the following script to install backend and
frontend dependencies and set up the database:

    bin/setup

This assumes that you have Ruby, PostgreSQL, and Redis installed on your
computer. If you don't, then you'll be given the appropriate instructions to
install these dependencies first.

To run the app, use [Heroku Local]:

    heroku local

## Development workflow

* The mainline branch is `master`.
* Create a card for a feature or bugfix on Trello.
* Cut feature or bugfix branches off of `master`.
* Write tests.
* Create pull requests on GitHub and get others to review your work.
* Rebase and squash your commits if needed to prevent cluttering up the history
  with needless commits.
* Merge those branches into `master` using `--ff-only` to prevent merge commits
  from being created.
* Deploy changes to staging so that the client can try out those changes in a
  live environment.
* Move cards on Trello to the appropriate columns as you are working.

## Testing

[RSpec] is used to write tests for Ruby code.

You can run the test suite for the project by saying:

    bundle exec rake

## Style

Ruby and JavaScript code follows a consistent style, enforced by [Rubocop] and
[ESLint]. Configure your editor to run code you write against these tools.
Configuration is kept in [`.rubocop.yml`](.rubocop.yml) and
[`.eslintrc.yml`](.eslintrc.yml).
